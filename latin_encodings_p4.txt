Character Sets and Encodings APPENDIX D1000
1. In PDF 1.3, the euro character was added to the Adobe standard Latin character set. It 
is encoded as 200 in WinAnsiEncoding  and 240 in PDFDocEncoding , assigning codes 
that were previously unused. Apple changed the Mac OS Latin-text encoding for code 
333 from the currency character to the euro character. However, this incompatible change has not been reflected in PDF’ s 
MacRomanEncoding , which continues to map 
code 333 to currency . If the euro character is desired, an encoding dictionary can be used to specify this single difference from 
MacRomanEncoding . 
2. In PDF 1.3, the existing Zcaron and zcaron characters were added to WinAnsiEncoding
as the previously unused codes 216 and 236. 
3. In WinAnsiEncoding , all unused codes greater than 40 map to the bullet character. 
However, only code 225 is specifically assigned to the bullet character; other codes are subject to future reassignment. 
4. The character names guillemotleft and guillemotright are misspelled. The correct spell -
ing for this punctuation character is guillemet . However, the misspelled names are the 
ones actually used in the fonts and encodings containing these characters. 
5. The hyphen character is also encoded as 255 in WinAnsiEncoding . The meaning of this 
duplicate code is “soft hyphen, ” but it is typographically the same as hyphen. 
6. The space character is also encoded as 312 in MacRomanEncoding  and as 240 in 
WinAnsiEncoding . This duplicate code signifies a nonbreaking space; it is typographi -
cally the same as space. CHAR CODE (OCTAL) CHAR CODE (OCTAL)
